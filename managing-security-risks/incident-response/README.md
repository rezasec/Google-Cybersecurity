## At a Glance  

- **Playbooks** = manuals with predefined steps for handling incidents.  
- Treated as **living documents** → updated for new threats, laws, and compliance.  
- Common types: **Incident Response** + **Vulnerability Response**.  
- Core phases of incident handling: **Preparation → Detection → Analysis → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Post-incident**.  
- Playbooks are used with **SIEM** (for monitoring) and **SOAR** (for automation).

## Playbooks Overview  

- A **playbook** = manual with detailed actions for security operations.  
- Provides consistency in incident handling.  
- Includes:  
  - **Strategy** → expectations of team roles.  
  - **Plan** → specific steps to perform tasks.  
- Managed collaboratively by teams with different expertise.  
- Updated when:  
  - Failures or oversights are identified.  
  - Laws or compliance requirements change.  
  - Threat actor tactics evolve.

## Types of Playbooks  

- **Incident Response Playbooks**  
  - Handle specific attacks (e.g., ransomware, phishing, BEC, vishing).  
  - Follow business continuity plans → minimize downtime.  
  - Ensure legal + organizational compliance.  

- **Vulnerability Response Playbooks**  
  - Steps to address known vulnerabilities.  
  - Urgency based on **likelihood × impact** of a threat.  
  - Used in coordination with forensic work to avoid mishandling evidence.

## Incident Response Phases  

Typical steps included in playbooks:  

1. **Preparation** → policies, training, tools ready in advance.  
2. **Detection** → identify suspicious activity or alerts.  
3. **Analysis** → confirm if an incident is real, scope the damage.  
4. **Containment** → limit spread (e.g., isolate systems).  
5. **Eradication** → remove malware or threat actor access.  
6. **Recovery** → restore systems, return to operations.  
7. **Post-incident** → lessons learned, update playbooks.

## Playbooks with SIEM & SOAR  

- **With SIEM**:  
  - Playbooks guide response when alerts are raised.  
  - Example: SIEM flags unusual login → playbook tells analyst which steps to follow.  

- **With SOAR**:  
  - SOAR automates repetitive responses (e.g., lock account after failed logins).  
  - Playbooks guide analysts on how to resolve after automation.  
  - Combination reduces analyst workload and speeds up incident handling.

## Key Takeaways  

- Playbooks = critical for structured, compliant, and efficient incident handling.  
- Must be continuously improved after each incident.  
- Used with both **SIEM** (monitoring) and **SOAR** (automation).  
- Reduce risk, minimize human error, and clarify responsibilities.

## Glossary  

- **Incident response** → quick actions to identify, contain, and recover from attacks.  
- **Playbook** → manual of operational actions with predefined steps for security teams.  
- **SOAR** → Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response; automates repetitive incident handling tasks.  
- **SIEM** → Security Information and Event Management; collects and analyzes logs to detect threats.
